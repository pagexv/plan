Based on the information you've provided, we can analyze potential vulnerabilities that might be exploitable, though further manual testing would be required to confirm if these are actual vulnerabilities. Here are some areas of interest where you might find security issues while testing the application for HackerOne:

### 1. **Cross-Domain Communication and LocalStorage Syncing**
   - **Potential Exploits**: Whenever multiple subdomains are involved and they use mechanisms like `localStorage` or cookies to share information, there could be risks related to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** or **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**.
   
   **What to Test**:
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: If any user-controlled data is stored in `localStorage` and is synced across subdomains, there could be a chance for an XSS attack. For example, if `smarttrader.deriv.com` or `p2p.deriv.com` improperly sanitizes user input before storing or loading it from `localStorage`, an attacker might be able to inject malicious JavaScript.
   - **Session Management**: Verify how sensitive session data (like authentication tokens) is stored in `localStorage`. If it's vulnerable to XSS, attackers could steal session tokens or manipulate stored data across subdomains.
   - **CSRF Attacks**: Test if cross-domain requests (such as `p2p.deriv.com` or `smarttrader.deriv.com`) are vulnerable to CSRF. If the app relies on tokens in `localStorage` for session validation, see if these tokens are properly protected.

   **Approach**:
   - Manually test if any user input can be injected into `localStorage` and then echoed back into the page in an unsafe manner (leading to XSS).
   - Check how session tokens are shared across subdomains and ensure they’re securely managed (using mechanisms like **HttpOnly** cookies or appropriate CSP).

### 2. **OAuth Flow – Open Redirect Vulnerabilities**
   - **Potential Exploits**: During the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow, there might be a chance for **open redirect** vulnerabilities, where attackers can trick users into clicking on a malicious link that redirects them to an unintended destination.
   
   **What to Test**:
   - **Open Redirect**: Test if the `oauth.deriv.com/authorize` endpoint properly validates the `redirect_uri` parameter (if present). Many OAuth implementations can be vulnerable to open redirect attacks if the allowed redirection URLs are not properly validated or whitelisted.
   - **Authorization Bypass**: Test if there’s any way to tamper with the OAuth flow to gain unauthorized access to protected resources or bypass the login screen.

   **Approach**:
   - Modify the URL parameters in the OAuth requests to include malicious redirection URLs. For example:
     ```http
     /authorize?app_id=16929&redirect_uri=https://malicious.com
     ```
   - If the app improperly handles redirect validation, it might allow an attacker to exploit the open redirect vulnerability to redirect users to phishing or malicious websites.

### 3. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Misconfiguration**
   - **Potential Exploits**: Since multiple subdomains are involved (`app.deriv.com`, `smarttrader.deriv.com`, `p2p.deriv.com`), there could be misconfigurations in the **CORS** settings that allow attackers to exploit cross-domain requests and retrieve sensitive information.
   
   **What to Test**:
   - **Loose CORS Policies**: Test if any of the subdomains allow unsafe cross-origin requests, which could enable an attacker to read sensitive data from another domain. Specifically, check if `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` or overly permissive settings are being used.
   - **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Verify if sensitive APIs are accessible cross-origin without proper authorization (e.g., session tokens or authentication headers being sent with requests across domains).

   **Approach**:
   - Use tools like **Burp Suite** or **OWASP ZAP** to manually check the responses from each subdomain for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header and test if you can make cross-origin requests from a malicious domain.
   - Craft cross-origin requests using a custom JavaScript script to test for CORS-related vulnerabilities.

### 4. **Session Management – CSRF Protection**
   - **Potential Exploits**: If the application doesn’t properly implement CSRF protections for sensitive actions (like deposits), this could allow attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of logged-in users.
   
   **What to Test**:
   - **CSRF Tokens**: Verify whether sensitive actions like the `/deposit` request are protected by anti-CSRF tokens. If the request is made without validating a CSRF token, it may be possible to craft a malicious link or form that tricks the user into performing unintended actions (such as transferring funds).
   - **Session Fixation**: Test if session tokens are properly rotated after login or significant actions. If not, this could allow session fixation attacks where an attacker sets a session ID for the user and later hijacks their session.

   **Approach**:
   - Use a proxy tool to intercept the deposit request and see if a valid CSRF token is required. Try submitting the form without the token or with an invalid token to check if the server accepts it.
   - Create an HTML form that mimics the deposit request and see if the user’s session is vulnerable to CSRF.

### 5. **NS_BINDING_ABORTED Requests – Resource Exhaustion or Misconfigured Services**
   - **Potential Exploits**: While the `NS_BINDING_ABORTED` status itself doesn't necessarily indicate a vulnerability, it can sometimes suggest potential performance issues or misconfigurations that could be exploitable through resource exhaustion or service denial attacks.
   
   **What to Test**:
   - **Resource Exhaustion**: Repeatedly trigger requests that are aborted (e.g., by switching between pages or triggering the OAuth flow) and observe if the system begins to degrade or if any error messages appear.
   - **Denial of Service (DoS)**: If requests are being unnecessarily aborted, it might lead to inefficient resource use. Flood the server with incomplete requests and see if it causes performance degradation or a denial-of-service condition.

   **Approach**:
   - Use a script or automation tool to repeatedly initiate and cancel requests (particularly large resource-heavy requests like scripts and images) to test the system's resilience.

### 6. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - **Potential Exploits**: If the platform doesn’t implement a strong **Content Security Policy (CSP)**, it may be vulnerable to XSS attacks across subdomains.
   
   **What to Test**:
   - **CSP Headers**: Check if CSP headers are properly configured across all subdomains (`app.deriv.com`, `smarttrader.deriv.com`, `p2p.deriv.com`). An improperly configured CSP can lead to XSS or other injection attacks.
   - **Script Injection**: Test for places where user input can be reflected in HTML or JavaScript. If there’s no CSP or a weak CSP in place, this could allow an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts.

   **Approach**:
   - Use tools like **Burp Suite** or **OWASP ZAP** to review the CSP headers returned by the server. If CSP is weak or absent, attempt to inject JavaScript into input fields or URL parameters to test for XSS.

### Summary of Potential Vulnerabilities:
1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Across multiple subdomains, especially if localStorage is used to store sensitive data.
2. **Open Redirect**: In the OAuth flow, if improper validation of `redirect_uri` occurs.
3. **CORS Misconfigurations**: Between subdomains that allow cross-origin requests in an unsafe manner.
4. **CSRF Vulnerabilities**: Particularly in sensitive actions like deposits, if anti-CSRF protections are absent or weak.
5. **Session Management Flaws**: Related to session fixation or improper session handling across multiple subdomains.
6. **Resource Exhaustion**: If repeated aborted requests lead to performance issues or a DoS condition.

### Next Steps:
- You can start testing each of these potential areas using **Burp Suite** or **OWASP ZAP** to intercept and manipulate requests, or craft payloads to explore these vulnerabilities.
- Always follow the program's rules on HackerOne to stay within the allowed scope while performing these tests.
